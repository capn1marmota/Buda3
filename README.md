This is a subway station optimizer.
Stations can be generated by modeling them
from 2 .tsv files: Stations.tsv to represent stations
and Connections.tsv to represent... you guessed it, connections.
Simply edit the specified files by adding the attributes indicated in the respective column headers.
("Estacion" and "color" for Stations.tsv and "Origen" and "Destino" for Connections.tsv).
The files already have a network modeled by default, so the program is ready to go, just run "main.py" and
provide the requested parameters.
Both "main.py" and "Estaciones.tsv" and "Conexiones.tsv" are located in the src folder.
The program includes
configurations for automatic tests by means of
the mypy, pytest and flake8 modules
